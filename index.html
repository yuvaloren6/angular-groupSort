        The <b>group And Sort</b> is a transcluding directive to will group an array of objects into categories as deep as you like.
        After grouping your objects into categories, you may sort your categories at every level and finally, sort your items.
    </p>
    <p>
        Objects may not be fully categorised, if some of the objects do not have as many sub-categories as other objects, they simply remain at the
        group into which they were categorised.
    </p>
    <p>
        Grouping and sorting is not mandatory. You can group item and skip sort or skip grouping and justsort items. (however, if you do not group -
        you cannot sort by categories).
    </p>
    Grouping and sorting of categories and items is acheived by calling your assigned grouping and sorting functions as described bellow.
    <p>
        The <b>group And Sort</b> directive does nothing until data is requested by its transcluded directive. You call the directive's 'data'
        function in order to retreive the groupd and sorted objects which are encapsulated in a convinient-to-retreive data structure.
    </p>
    <h3>Dependencies</h3>
    The <b>Angular Group and Sort</b> sole dependency is on AngularJS 1.5.6 [get AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/)
    <h3>Demo</h3>
    Below you can see a grouping of the american and National Baseball teams into divisions. The leage, divisions and clubs are than sorted in
    asccending order. Since, I "forgot" to sub-categorise the "New York Yankees" and the "Boston Red Sox", both teams were correctly grouped into
    the American leage, but both appear at the same level as the leage's divisions.

        <grouping-tree></grouping-tree>
    </div>
    <h3 style="margin-top:30px">Properties</h3>
    The directive exihibts the following properties:
    <h4>objects</h4>
    An array of objects you wish to group and/or sort.
    <h4>group-by</h4>
    The name of the grouping function used for dividing objects into different caregories. The function will be passed an object and a level
    (specifying grouping depth) one at a time until all objects are categorised. The function is expected to return a string (the category name) or
    null if the item has been fully categorised.
    <pre>
    <code>
groupingFunction = function(object, level) {
    your grouping logic ...
    return categoryName or return null
}
        </code>
    </pre>
    <h4>sort-categories</h4>
    The name of sorting function used to sort categories (only when grouping is in effect). The function will be passed two category names at a
    time and should return a value less than zero if the first category should be ordered before the second category, zero if the
    categories may appear in any order, or a value greater than zero if the second category should be ordered before the first.
    <pre>
    <code>
categorySortingFunction = function(categoryName1, categoryName2) {
	your sorting logic ...
	return -1 // category1 appears before category2
	or return 0 // either one may appear before the other
	or return 1 // category2 appears before category1
}
        </code>
    </pre>
    <h4>sort-items</h4>
    The name of sorting function used to sort the inputed objects (regardless of grouping and/or categry sorting). The function will be passed
    two objects at a time and should return a value less than zero if the first object should be ordered before the second object,
    zero if the objects may appear in any order, or a value greater than zero if the second object should be ordered before the first.
    <pre>
    <code>
itemSortingFunction=function(obj1, obj2) {
    your sorting logic ...
    return -1 // obj1 appears before obj2
    or return 0 // either one may appear before the other
    or return 1 // obj2 appears before obj1
}
        </code>
    </pre>
    <h3>Methods</h3>
    <h4>data</h4>
    The data function should be called by the transcluded directive in order to pull its data from the <b>Group and Sort</b> directive. Only then will the directive
    proccess its input array of objects - group and sort (categories and/or items) if needed - before returning an array of output objects as specified bellow:
    <pre>
        <code>
[
    {
        category: categoryName,
        objects: [ array of objects ]
    },
]
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
        The value of the top-most category will always be null as this is the root of the catgories tree.
    </p>
    <p>
        If no grouping is requested, then all the objects are present in the 'objects' array. (the objects may still be sorted, if a sort-items function was provided
        to the directive.)
    </p>
    <p>
        If grouping is requested, then each category will be manifested in the 'object' array as an object whose properties are 'category' and 'objects' and whose behavior imitates
        the top-most object depicted above. At each level objects who are not categorised are collected into an array which is the last element of the objects array.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, categorised objects are always an object as the one described above, and done categorised objects if any are in an array who is the last element in the objects
        array.
    </p>
    <p>
        IF all your objects are fully categorised, then you need not worry about not fully categorised items. All your objects will like the one above, and all your objects
        will be at leafs.
    </p>
